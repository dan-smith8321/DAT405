DAT405 assignment!

My project itself may not be flashy or will make you or others go "WOW" however
I decided to base my project on something that I had a genuine interest in which
is Spyro. It's a game which was my childhood, at first it was hard to think of
ways to base my project on it. However eventually I thought up of what I produced.
I was going to do a countdown originally till It's re release which was the 15th November, so I had the idea of including some sort of clock/timer the whole time.
However the different images and incorparating sound all came to my
head once I started actually making my assignment. The actual project itself is a working digital clock which includes images and sound built into it.
